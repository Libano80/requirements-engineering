# Requirements Engineering Project

The scope of this project concerns the application of some requirements engineering techniques on a real-world system.

The main steps of the project are:
 1. Project proposal 
 
    A real-world system is proposed and informally described.

    The results of this step are reported in the 'Project proposal Requirements Engineering.pdf' file.
    
 2. Requirements elicitation
 
    The requirements are elicited, the strategic and tactical goals are analysed, some alternative solutions are presented and then the final solution is chosen. In particular, the KAOS methodology is used to model the goals.
    
    The results of this step are reported in the 'goal_modeling_Gatto_Laino.pdf' file.
    
 3. Solution specification
 
    The specifications of the chosen solution are modeled using the Problem Frames approach.
    
    The results of this step are reported in the 'problem_frames_Laino_Gatto.pdf' file.
    
 4. Feasibility analysis
 
    A comparison of different business strategies is performed in order to evaluate whether the project implementation and deployment are feasible.
    
    The results of this step are reported in the 'feasibility_analysis_Laino_Gatto.pdf' file.
